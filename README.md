# Open EBTS

Copied from the [Open Biometrics Initiative.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openbiometrics/)

A copy of the OpenEBTS project. Dealing with SourceForge was just too annoying.

OpenEBTS is a library for working with Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS) files. 

EBTS has variants based on the implementing agency. DOD EBTS extends FBI EBTS which extends NIST. Each EBTS specification also encompasses multiple versions. See the [Registry of USG Recommended Biometric Standards](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/support-registry-us-recommended-biometric-standards) for a reasonably complete history of standards.

## Current Standards

[NIST](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/ansinist-itl-standard)

ANSI/NIST-ITL-2011

[FBI](https://www.fbibiospecs.cjis.gov/EBTS/Approved)

EBTS v10.0

[DOD](https://www.dfba.mil/functions/library/standards.html)

EBTS 4.1 *

> EBTS 1.2 is still the most widely used and supported EBTS format.

[DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/obim)

DHS Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) uses an XML based format that is not built on the EBTS standard. DHS IDENT is expected to be replaced by DHS Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) in 2020-2021.
